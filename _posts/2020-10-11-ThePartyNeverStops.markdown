Here is the link to the article: [Here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/3b7w79/when-does-the-party-stop)

My friend showed me this article, and I was confused. My first instinct was to accept it as accurate. If it shows up on a blog, it must be true. Why would anyone publish it if it wasn't right? Well, now that I reread it, it could be true, it might not be true, but the real question I want to ask is what does it mean to grow up?

Does it mean to have a spouse and kids? Does it mean to make $xyz,000 a year? Should you wake up every day and go about your day as you would regardless of it being the weekend or the weekday. Do you give up alcohol? No clue!

The article does a great job (maybe) to tell you why this generation drinks all day, and that it should not be like that. Well, I agree with the author that this generation might be pushing growing up into the future, but is that necessarily a bad thing? 

As I said, I have no clue... But I will update it as I figure it out I guess.
