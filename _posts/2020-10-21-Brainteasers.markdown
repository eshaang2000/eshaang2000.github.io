## Horse race

There are 25 horses, each of which runs at a constant speed that is different from the other horses. The track only has 5 lanes, so each race can run only 5 horses. If you need to find the 3 fastest horses, what is the minimum number of races needed to identify them?

Answer: 7

## Gosh I hate primes

Any integer N can be expressed as follows:
N = p1^a1 *p2^a2* p3^a3 *...
Where pn is a distinct prime number, and an is its exponent
For eg: 28 = 2^2* 7^1

Furthermore, the number of divisors D(N) of any integer N can be computed from:
D(N) = (a1+1) *(a2+1)* (a3+1) *...
an being the exponents of the distinct prime numbers which are factors of N
For example, the number of divisors of 28 would thus be:
D(28) = (2+1)*(1+1) = 3*2 = 6
