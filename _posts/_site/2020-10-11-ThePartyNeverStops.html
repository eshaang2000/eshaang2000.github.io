<p>Here is the link to the article: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3b7w79/when-does-the-party-stop">Here</a></p>

<p>My friend showed me this article, and I was confused. My first instinct was to accept it as accurate. If it shows up on a blog, it must be true. Why would anyone publish it if it wasn’t right? Well, now that I reread it, it could be true, it might not be true, but the real question I want to ask is what does it mean to grow up?</p>

<p>Does it mean to have a spouse and kids? Does it mean to make $xyz,000 a year? Should you wake up every day and go about your day as you would regardless of it being the weekend or the weekday. Do you give up alcohol? No clue!</p>

<p>The article does a great job (maybe) to tell you why this generation drinks all day, and that it should not be like that. Well, I agree with the author that this generation might be pushing growing up into the future, but is that necessarily a bad thing?</p>

<p>As I said, I have no clue… But I will update it as I figure it out I guess.</p>
