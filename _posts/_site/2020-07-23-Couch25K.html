<h1 id="i-really-dislike-running">I Really Dislike Running</h1>

<p>Well I don’t know the reason. It might be because it can be just too hard. So, I never really understood the need to run. I could do other forms of excerice. Then the covid 19 pandemic hit. I was left without a gym or weights to use. This is now forcing me to run to maintain (honestly, to rebuild) cardiovascular fitness. I tried running but just did not have a plan of what to do. After searching for an effective plan, I decided to give Couch to 5k a try. Now let’s see how that goes.</p>

<p>Update 1:</p>

<p>I feel like I am making good progress. I’ve slowly getting my lungs up to speed to pre-covid levels. Just finished Week 4, and got pretty close to a 5k.</p>

<p>Update 2:</p>

<p>Just finished Week 6. Again making good progress, especially considering I have never actually run seriously before. Will upload run data from all workouts soon</p>
