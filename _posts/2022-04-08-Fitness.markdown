description: My analysis of my fitness competition
---
The fitness competition has been a great addition to my life. It has moved my focus from partying and having fun my last semester to optimizing my life to do better in this (stupid) fitness competition. It is an abstract concept that pushes both Thomas (my competitor) and me to our limits. We even started calling the first day "opening day," which I find both ridiculous and incredibly funny at the same time. I even think that blogging about day-to-day performance is a worthwhile endeavor. 

# 04/08 - Opening Day

I slept very late on 04/07 and hence woke up pretty late. I got 7 hours and 10 mins of sleep with a 96% sleep rating from my autosleep app. I also woke up with a catch in my neck accompanied by a headache. I was delighted to see that Thomas also had a pretty slow start to the day. He is also prepping for an important exam, but this competition is obviously more important. I had a readiness score of 2.74/5.00, again according to my autosleep app. Not an ideal start, so I would have to push even harder. 

My friend Puja came with a save when we decided to go on a walk. These were precious points while Thomas was busy lounging on his couch. We walked for 75 minutes, and I burned ~300 active calories. This made me realize that since I am so inefficient with cardio, especially walking and running, I burn a good amount of calories for a pretty low-time investment. The optimal strategy seems to include more cardio in the routine. 

I then hung out with someone and then decided to hit the gym. I was pretty late and exhausted. My sleep performance also did not help. This resulted in a low-intensity workout. Thankfully I had the walk to cover up the ground. I ended the day with some disgusting food that will be hard to work off tomorrow. The 50 point lead will be helpful in that. We finished the day with 506 points for me vs. 447 for Thomas.
