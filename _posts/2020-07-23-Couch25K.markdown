# I Really Dislike Running

Well I don't know the reason. It might be because it can be just too hard. So, I never really understood the need to run. I could do other forms of excerice. Then the covid 19 pandemic hit. I was left without a gym or weights to use. This is now forcing me to run to maintain (honestly, to rebuild) cardiovascular fitness. I tried running but just did not have a plan of what to do. After searching for an effective plan, I decided to give Couch to 5k a try. Now let's see how that goes. 

Update 1: 

I feel like I am making good progress. I've slowly getting my lungs up to speed to pre-covid levels. Just finished Week 4, and got pretty close to a 5k.

Update 2:

Just finished Week 6. Again making good progress, especially considering I have never actually run seriously before. Will upload run data from all workouts soon
