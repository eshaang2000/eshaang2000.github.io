So what are Hamiltonian Cycles? 

A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every node (vertex) is visited exactly once. A loop is just an edge that joins a node to itself; so a Hamiltonian cycle is a path traveling from a point back to itself, visiting every node en route.

Now there are various Hamiltonian Cycles that can be found on a chess board, where every space is a node and the edges are decided by how the pieces move. For my combinatorics class, my team and I explored various graphs that came out of these chess pieces and we use them to find out how many hamiltonian cycles are possible.
