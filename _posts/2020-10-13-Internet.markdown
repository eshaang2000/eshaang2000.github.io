description: You can learn anything you want from the internet

Hey! I hypothesize that you can learn anything you want from the internet. I know this is a prevalent saying and most of the people I know believe in it too. Then why are we still going to colleges or class when you can learn the same thing you learned in an hour and twenty minutes in 10 minutes on youtube. Why do students still want to go to class? To prove my point, I am going to go through my own experience. I procrastinate a lot, and [parkinsons's law](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/what-is-parkinsons-law#:~:text=Parkinson's%20Law%20is%20the%20old,for%20the%20Economist%20in%201955) catches up to me pretty often. So I have to self teach myself the entire curriculum. So far, I have been able to finesse a good grade 23/26 times. I used to consider myself lucky (and I am), but there is something else going on. Maybe self-learning and learning by doing is the most effective way to do things! So coming back to the point, I have been slacking hard on this class, Software Methodology, and I will catch up on my own. While I do that, I will document what I am doing and what resources I am using.

## Software Methodology

This class is a precursor to software engineering. It teaches you (outdated) stuff (albeit important) about OOPS. The language is java. I

Key points

1. You don't want to be writing a lot of code repeatedly
2. You can have a class that describes a top-level object, and you can go into specifics later. 
For example - Class Animal can be defined, and then you can define your favorite animal - Dog later on. 
3. The premise is that every animal will have the attributes - no of limbs etc. and then a dog will have a specific feature like cuteness level

Superclass and subclass!!

### Polymorphism

Key Points

1. Polymorphism is the ability to take many forms
2. Every instance of a subclass is a specialization of a superclass
3. You can always pass an instance of a subclass to a parameter of its superclass

### Abstract classes and Interfaces

Key points

1. They are just organizational tools
2. They force the programmer to code in a certain way 
3. They define a blueprint for coding

Nothing much here

More to come!
