description: My experiences with Fitness in my life.

First, some housekeeping, it has become evident to me that no one reads these, which is fine. I obviously don't post enough, and I will try to post more. Even though this is my second time posting this, I think this time will be good.

So fitness, well, I've been working out for a while now. I think I started in 2016 when I was considerably overweight, Borderline obese even, but my height used to mask it. I would get in front of the mirror and lie to myself, saying everything was ok. I was able to do all regular activities without a problem and was a pretty good powerlifter for a 16-year-old. When I look back at the numbers now, they were alright. Nothing too crazy, especially given that I was probably 220lbs/100kgs. I then seriously decided to lose weight. It was summer, and I was looking for something to do anyway. I proceeded to drop 35lbs/15kg and discovered calorie counting. In my mind, this was the end of the struggle. Only way but up, but then that's not it. All those bad habits keep creeping back up. You don't realize it, and you've put the weight back again. 

A couple of yo-yo's later, I reach college. Mostly large, but nothing alarming. The stress of moving to another country, making new friends, and experiencing college got to me. I put on a considerable amount of weight. At this point in my life, I had a pretty unhealthy relationship with food, dieting, and working out. It was always all or nothing, and that doesn't work. I also joined to rowing team and made some decent progress out there but could never breach the barrier of a "very low" body fat percentage. 

Now, what am I doing differently? 
1. Tracking - I am tracking everything I can and trying my best. I track sleep, weight, calories eaten, calories burnt, workouts (using the strongapp), and resting heart rate. A slight digression - The next step is to track pages read - not relating to fitness, but it's a good habit. 
2. While tracking is essential, there's not much benefit if you don't do anything about it. The next step is to make sleep extremely consistent, albeit hard in a college environment; not impossible, though. 
3. I am naturally a very competitive person, so I've gotten into a fitness competition with a good friend. If you have an Apple watch, you can challenge a person to a fitness competition, and you can earn points based on active calories burnt, exercise minutes, and standing up throughout the day. What makes this even more fun is that the winner gets $20 from the other person. This competition has been the best thing for both my friend and me. We have been way more consistent and push harder at the gym than usual. 

My current run has been going pretty decent. I feel good, and I am making decent progress in the gym. My eating habits have also been good. Consumption of alcohol is probably the most significant thing different now. Alcohol destroys your inhibitions and makes calorie-dense food and nicotine irresistible. The current project is to optimize sleep, cardiovascular exercise, and mobility the best I can. 

Till next time,
