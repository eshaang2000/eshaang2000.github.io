## What is virtue ethics?

So, what is virtue ethics? According to the University of Texas, "virtue ethics is this character-based approach to morality, assuming that we acquire virtue through practice. By practicing being honest, brave, just, generous, and so on, a person develops an honorable and moral character" (University of Texas Virtue Ethics). So, people will act in the right way by having virtuous habits without even thinking about it when faced with an ethical dilemma. Let us relate this to the classic trolley problem. A utilitarian view would say that a person must steer the track with one man on it. This action would increase the overall utility of the situation because instead of five people, only one would die. The Kantian or deontological view would be that it is incorrect for one to kill, and by pulling the lever, you have effectively murdered that one person, so it is immoral. A virtue ethicist would say that we should steer the trolley away because saving more lives is not about happiness or well-being; it is merely the kind of thing a virtuous person would do (Virtue Ethics Trolley Problem).

## Wait! What is virtue?

The above is the premise of virtue ethics. The term virtue is interesting to explore. What exactly, is a virtue? A virtue is a trait of a human that is morally good and is the foundation of principle and good moral being. Plato and Aristotle came up with a set of cardinal and moral virtues, but this list is not exhaustive. The crux of virtues and virtue ethics is that no action is good or bad. You can always learn from the action and be more virtuous the next time. It is about developing a habit of being good. Aristotle said, "you are what you repeatedly do." So, to be a good person, one must continuously practice being a good person.

I think virtue ethics is the ethical theory that we must incorporate in our lives. I believe this because virtue ethics account for the fundamental difference between people. Every person is fundamentally different because each person has had a different upbringing and experiences, most of which were entirely out of their hand. So, if a person can or cannot follow a moral law rulebook is dependent on the person itself. For some, it is incredibly hard to be righteous if one is born in unfortunate circumstances. In contrast, it is easy to be righteous if they are born in fortunate circumstances. Virtue ethics eliminates this problem and makes people strive to be virtuous while rewarding them for each moral act with eudaimonia or human flourishing. Eudaimonia is the feeling one gets after a day where one finishes all the tasks at hand.

## Eudaimonia

Well, every night, you want to be content that what you did was enough. Now my theory is that there is infinite work you can do. So how do you stop working for the day? 

For example, if you make a todo list of everything you have to do in the morning, and you finish all of the tasks, and you have time left. Do you send it with more work, so you get a head start the next day or take it easy? You should only do things that you want to do, but then you are stuck in a hedonistic trap. There is a delicate balance somewhere. The probability of hitting that is like hitting a royal flush (impossible). Do you keep working until you can't work anymore? Like most of my posts, I don't have a concrete answer, but I hope to update it if I get to it.
