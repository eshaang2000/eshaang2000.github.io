For example, let’s say I flip a coin, and I ask you to guess how it landed. You say tails, and I show it to you as heads. We go again, and it heads also. We go again and again. We go 100 times, and it’s heads every single time. Well, do you still believe that the next flip is going to be tails? Theoretically, it should be 1/2 or 50%, but is it? Even a six-year-old kid would catch on and say that there is a 100% chance that the next flip is going to be heads. On the other hand, a computer that is fundamentally objective is going to say that it is a 50% chance. Is she* right?? Hell no!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about sports? What does it mean that the Lakers have a 60% chance to win the NBA. Well, how do you quantify that? Do you count up all the points and rate them accordingly? Do you look at previous wins and come up with the number? Or is it just intuition? One of my friends said that every event is  50-50, it happens or it does not. I’m pretty sure that it was as a joke, but I unironically said that to a probability professor, and I got utterly flamed, so I refrain from making judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that to test if someone’s belief is true, one must be willing to bet if they were given odds according to the probability they gave us. If they are not, then you should probably not listen to them. I mean, definitely not listen to them. The likelihood of an event happening depends on the amount of information you have. For the same event, if you have a lot of info (likely not going to happen), you can arrive at a more precise probability. While if you have no information (most likely how things happen in life - like in poker), you will not be able to come up with a precise probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating problem - how we can make the best decisions with limited information.&lt;/p&gt;

I hypothesize that you can learn anything you want from the internet. I know this is a prevalent saying and most of the people I know believe in it too. Then why are we still going to colleges or class when you can learn the same thing you learned in an hour and twenty minutes in 10 minutes on youtube. Why do students still want to go to class? To prove my point, I am going to go through my own experience. I procrastinate a lot, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/what-is-parkinsons-law#:~:text=Parkinson's%20Law%20is%20the%20old,for%20the%20Economist%20in%201955&quot;&gt;parkinsons’s law&lt;/a&gt; catches up to me pretty often. So I have to self teach myself the entire curriculum. So far, I have been able to finesse a good grade 23/26 times. I used to consider myself lucky (and I am), but there is something else going on. Maybe self-learning and learning by doing is the most effective way to do things! So coming back to the point, I have been slacking hard on this class, Software Methodology, and I will catch up on my own. While I do that, I will document what I am doing and what resources I am using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-methodology&quot;&gt;Software Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This class is a precursor to software engineering. It teaches you (outdated) stuff (albeit important) about OOPS. The language is java. I&lt;/p&gt;

Key points&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t want to be writing a lot of code repeatedly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can have a class that describes a top-level object, and you can go into specifics later. 
For example - Class Animal can be defined, and then you can define your favorite animal - Dog later on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The premise is that every animal will have the attributes - no of limbs etc. and then a dog will have a specific feature like cuteness level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superclass and subclass!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video watched - 
Key Points&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Polymorphism is the ability to take many forms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every instance of a subclass is a specialization of a superclass&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can always pass an instance of a subclass to a parameter of its superclass&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are just organizational tools&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend showed me this article, and I was confused. My first instinct was to accept it as accurate. If it shows up on a blog, it must be true. Why would anyone publish it if it wasn’t right? Well, now that I reread it, it could be true, it might not be true, but the real question I want to ask is what does it mean to grow up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it mean to have a spouse and kids? Does it mean to make $xyz,000 a year? Should you wake up every day and go about your day as you would regardless of it being the weekend or the weekday. Do you give up alcohol? No clue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article does a great job (maybe) to tell you why this generation drinks all day, and that it should not be like that. Well, I agree with the author that this generation might be pushing growing up into the future, but is that necessarily a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I have no clue… But I will update it as I figure it out I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>EshaanGandhi</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Life" /><category term="Philosophy" /><summary type="html">Here is the link to the article: Here</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Poker</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Poker/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Poker" /><published>2020-10-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Poker</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Poker/">&lt;p&gt;You might be asking, “why should I believe this dude on the internet,” and you’re right. Why should you believe me? If I were you, I would not believe in whatever I am going to tell you. All I ask you is to try this strategy with low stakes games for a couple of times, and you’ll make enough cash to buy yourself a meal, like chipotle. This post is also a running document for me, as a note for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive right into it. Poker is about probability, and probability is hard. You might be thinking probability is just counting outcomes, and you might be correct to a certain extent. Poker is all about counting the number of outs you have and getting the right odds. It is also trying to avoid the risk of ruin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your first goal should be to survive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your second goal should be to minimize losses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The third goal is to make some money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College students also “love to play the person.” Under no circumstance should you try to play the man. No one knows what they are doing in particular hands. It is very beneficial to note what kind of player a person is. In college, people love to chase hands. If you see a draw getting there, tread with caution, it is reasonable to assume they got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t like playing with beginners, but all you have to do is wait for them to make a mistake and take their chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last thing for right now:
Position: This might be the most important thing. I’ll keep it simple, you see KJ on the button, you smile, but if you get the same KJ on the small blind, throw that into the muck ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The later you have to make a move, the more “looser” you could play, and the more attacking you could play.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>EshaanGandhi</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Math" /><category term="Probability" /><category term="Poker" /><summary type="html">You might be asking, “why should I believe this dude on the internet,” and you’re right.

Problem .We want to prove our conjecture: the numbers of walks in a Manhattan lattice
(w/o Broadway) from (0,0) to (m,n) is given by the formula(mm+!·nn!)!

```
Proof.We use the mathematical technique of induction
Base case (m = 0, n) OR (m, n = 0):
There is onlyoneway you could walk up from (0,0) to either (m,0) or (0,n)
Inductive Hypothesis:
Assume the total number of walks you could make from (0,0) to (m-1, n) is((mm+−n1)!−·1)!n! AND
Assume the total number of walks you could make from (0,0) to (m, n-1) is ((mm)!+·(nn−−1)!1)!
Inductive Step: We must show: number of walks from (0,0) to (m,n) is(mm+!·nn!)!
The number of walks to (m,n) are simply the sum of the walks to (m-1, n) and (m, n-1)
```
```
T he number of walks to(m, n) =
(m+n−1)!
(m−1)!·n!

(m+n−1)!

This is the desired result. QED

There is a much faster way to do it and that is using Maple, so that’s pretty ridiculous.

\begin{problem}{} %You can use theorem, proposition, exercise, or reflection here.  Modify x.yz to be whatever number you are proving
%Delete this text and write theorem statement here. We can draw the sets $\R$, $\Q$, $\I$, $\Z$, and $\N$. Let's assume our problem was: Prove that: $$(\forall x \in \N) \left [\sum_{i = 0}^{n}i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right ]$$
We want to prove our conjecture: the numbers of walks in a Manhattan lattice (w/o Broadway) from (0,0) to (m,n) is given by the formula ${\frac{(m+n)!}{m!\cdot n!}}$
\end{problem}
 
\begin{proof}
We use the mathematical technique of induction\\
%Note 1: The * tells LaTeX not to number the lines.  If you remove the *, be sure to remove it below, too.
%Note 2: Inside the align environment, you do not want to use $-signs.  The reason for this is that this is already a math environment. This is why we have to include \text{} around any text inside the align environment.
\textbf{Base case (m = 0, n) OR (m, n = 0):} \\There is only {\bfseries one} way you could walk up from (0,0) to either (m,0) or (0,n) \\
\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis: } \\Assume the total number of walks you could make from (0,0) to (m-1, n) is ${\frac{(m+n-1)!}{(m-1)!\cdot n!}}$ AND\\
Assume the total number of walks you could make from (0,0) to (m, n-1) is ${\frac{(m+n-1)!}{(m)! \cdot (n-1)!}}$
\textbf{Inductive Step: } We must show: number of walks from (0,0) to (m,n) is ${\frac{(m+n)!}{m!\cdot n!}}$
\\
The number of walks to (m,n) are simply the sum of the walks to (m-1, n) and (m, n-1) 
\begin{align*}
The\  number\ of\ walks\ to\ (m,n) &amp;= {\frac{(m+n-1)!}{(m-1)!\cdot n!}} + {\frac{(m+n-1)!}{(m)!\cdot (n-1)!}}\\
&amp;=(m+n-1)!\cdot \left( \frac{1}{(m-1)!\cdot n!}+\frac{1}{m!\cdot (n-1)!} \right)\\
&amp;=(m+n-1)!\cdot \left( \frac{1}{(m-1)!\cdot n \cdot (n-1)!}+\frac{1}{m\cdot (m-1)!\cdot (n-1)!} \right)\cdot \\
&amp;=\frac{(m+n-1)!}{(m-1)!\cdot (n-1)!}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m}\right)\\
&amp;=\frac{(m+n-1)!}{(m-1)!\cdot (n-1)!}\cdot \left(\frac{m+n}{nm}\right)\\
&amp;=\frac{(m+n)!}{m!\cdot n!}
\end{align*}
This is the desired result. QED

There is a much faster way to do it and that is using Maple, so that's pretty ridiculous.

In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position. In other words, a derangement is a permutation that has no fixed points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So number of these can be estimated pretty nicely using eulers number, but we hate estimations. So I wrote a maple procedure to calculate the number of derangements.&lt;/p&gt;

You can think of a MonteCarlo simulator as throwing a lot of darts at a board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets say the board was a unit square with a unit quadrant like the following image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;MonteCarlo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dart Board&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we throw a lot of darts onto this board &lt;strong&gt;randomly&lt;/strong&gt;. The probability of being inside the quadrant is going the be the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;Area of Quadrant/Area of Square&lt;/script&gt;. We count the numbers of darts that actually landed inside the quadrant and those that did not. If we run this a lot of times, we get a pretty good estimate of the  probability of the dart landing inside the the quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we now get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{Number of times dart is inside the quadrant}{number of total darts thrown} = \frac{Area of Quadrant}{Area of Square}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we used unit squares and quadrants so Area of Quadrant is &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\frac{\Pi}{4}&lt;/script&gt; and Area of the Square is 1. So if we just multiply the Probability we got by 4, we get the value of Pi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my python code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

The problem that I came across was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the problem better imagine that an area is conducting an election where for a candidate to win, they have to get more that 50% of the votes. Each candidate is given a numberical id and every time someone votes for the candidate we add the id to the array. So if the array is [7, 7, 9, 10] someone came in voted for candidate number 7, then someone else came in voted for 7 again. Then someone else came in and voted for candidate number 9. So and so forth we populate the array. Since there are going to be a lot of votes we need to find a quick way to get the majority element. This is where this algorithm shines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically we want to see if there is one over powering element like in an election. One number vs all the numbers in the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the array be
[7, 3, 7, 9, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of this array is 11 and there are 6 ‘7’ elements. This makes the desired answer as 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorihtm basically divides and kills the array. For eg:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[7, 3] [7, 9] [7, 6] [7, 7, 7, 8, 9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the first block: [7, 3] - if this section of the array was disregarded from the array, it would make no difference to the election, because the both ‘cancel’ each other. So let’s look at the code for this algorithm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;majorityElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contender&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++){&lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contender&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]){&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the complexity analysis: We only went through the array once so this would be O(n) time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>EshaanGandhi</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Algorithms" /><category term="Coding" /><summary type="html">Let’s get straight into it.

&lt;!-- During Fall 2020, I saw one of my friends take a &quot;probability&quot; quiz for some trading position. I thought the questions were pretty nice. Then I took an actual probability class at school. It was fun and hard at the same time. Here I will compile a list of all probability problems that I found interesting. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s dive right in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is not really probability but still interesting and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q. A horizontal stick is one metre long. Fifty ants are placed in random positions on the stick, pointing in random directions. The ants crawl head first along the stick, moving at one metre per minute. If an ant reaches the end of the stick, it falls off. If two ants meet, they both change direction. How long do you have to wait to be sure that all the ants have fallen off the stick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Super fun question like I said. First look at the base case. What is the maximum time an ant would take to fall of the plank if it was the only one on the plank. Since it’s a 1 meter plank, at most the ant would take 1 minute to fall off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the collisions: long story short - the collisions dont matter. When two ants collide they switch directions. Assuming that they don’t take anytime switching directions, the number of ants moving in either direction remain the same. Since ants are indistinguashable, the “energy” (for lack of a better word) one ant is carrying keeps on going in the same direction and maintains its speed until it falls off.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>eshaan</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Math" /><summary type="html">Trading Interview Problem</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Couch to 5K</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Couch25K/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Couch to 5K" /><published>2020-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Couch25K</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Couch25K/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-really-dislike-running&quot;&gt;I Really Dislike Running&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I don’t know the reason. It might be because it can be just too hard. So, I never really understood the need to run. I could do other forms of excerice. Then the covid 19 pandemic hit. I was left without a gym or weights to use. This is now forcing me to run to maintain (honestly, to rebuild) cardiovascular fitness. I tried running but just did not have a plan of what to do. After searching for an effective plan, I decided to give Couch to 5k a try. Now let’s see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I am making good progress. I’ve slowly getting my lungs up to speed to pre-covid levels. Just finished Week 4, and got pretty close to a 5k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just finished Week 6. Again making good progress, especially considering I have never actually run seriously before. Will upload run data from all workouts soon&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>EshaanGandhi</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="C25K" /><category term="Fitness" /><category term="Running" /><summary type="html">I Really Dislike Running</summary></entry></feed>
